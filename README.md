# UNF-Data-Structures-Java
These are projects created for the Data Structures course at UNF. This course uses Java

Project 1
    - This project takes a file named Countries.csv and reads the contents into an array of Country objects. It will then print the entire array to show the contents have been loaded properly
    
Project 2
    - This project follows up on Project 1. It will take a file named Countries2.csv and read the contents into 5 priority queue's, each of which are arrays of Countryb objects, based on the countries GDP per capita (poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent). After reading the contents it will load each priority queue, starting from the lowest class, into a stack and then print the stack to show that the priority queues worked properly by removing the prioritized elements.
    
Project 3
